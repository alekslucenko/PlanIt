Added
- HostAnalyticsService.swift: real-time aggregation of host metrics (revenue, customers, events, attendees, avg size) with timeframe filtering and daily buckets.
- Extended HostMetrics with growth percentage placeholders.
- Bound HostDashboardViews to HostAnalyticsService; timeframe picker wired.
- PartyManager skips user discovery in host mode, restores on switch.
- PerformanceOptimizationService throttles auto optimize (>=60s).

Fixes
- Custom Codable for Party avoids missing field crashes.
- Build error: added growth properties to HostMetrics.
- Regular user content now forces `showTabBar = true` onAppear to guarantee bottom toolbar.
- Refined skeleton view: five placeholders sized to match header & card rows; shimmer effect; overlay no longer covers tab bar.

Tech Stack: SwiftUI, FirebaseFirestore (async listeners), Combine (@Published), Custom struct aggregation.

UI POLISH  (Patch C)
- Added UI/Components/GlassComponents.swift containing GlassMetricCard, GlassButtonStyle, DailyLineChartView (glassmorphic, interactive).
- HostDashboardViews now uses GlassMetricCard grid and DailyLineChartView.
- Converted "Create Event" button in HostPartiesView (inside ModernMainTabView) to GlassButtonStyle.
- Converted navigation buttons in PartyCreationView to GlassButtonStyle.
- Wrapped noisy prints in ModernMainTabView behind #if DEBUG.

Build fixes
- Removed public access modifiers from Glass components to resolve access-level error.
- Added Equatable conformance to DailyMetricPoint to satisfy SwiftUI animation requirement.

+MAIN SCREEN PERFORMANCE (Patch – cache & skeleton)
+ - PlaceDataService: added `dailyTTL` and `hasFreshCache()`; skips Google Places fetch if cache <24h.
+ - ModernMainScreen: added skeleton shimmer overlay (RoundedRectangle placeholders) shown until cached data publishes; hides once `placesByCategory` non-empty.
+ - Added simple `shimmer()` modifier in GlassComponents.
+ - ModernMainScreen observes cache via Combine to hide skeleton.
+ - Tab bar ensured when leaving host mode.

+LOAD FLOW FIX
+ - Re-enabled PlaceDataService.activate() & DynamicCategoryManager.activate() when entering user mode (ModernMainTabView.handleHostModeChange).
+ - ModernMainScreen.onAppear activates services; content now uses if/else so underlying empty-state is not visible; skeleton fully replaces content.
